IoT USB Switch
--------------

USB Power switch. Control the power to a USB powered device (e.g. light) via an internet connected Particle Photon. 

Also measures current consumption as well as in and out voltages.


Rev1:
-----

Initial version. 3 boards build, appears to work!

Issues:
* PCB was a little too long and needed a small amount removed at the USB plug.
* With headers and a socket the Photon is very tall. It's mounted on the bottom of the board with USB plug and socket on the top which makes it a little odd.
* Photon in headers is about the same height as a Double USB socket, LM3526M-L is a dual output device so Rev2 probably worth making dual output as little extra expence.
